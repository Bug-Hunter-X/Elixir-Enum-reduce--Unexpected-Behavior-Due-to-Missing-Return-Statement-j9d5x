```elixir
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Enum.reduce(list, 0, fn x, acc ->
  if rem(x, 2) == 0 do
    acc + x
  else
    acc
  end
  # Missing return statement here!
  # This causes the function to return the last expression evaluated in the if/else block
  # Which might not be the intended accumulator value.
end)
```
